This file adds a number of supplementary indexes to the Healthcare model.
Note that all entity and enumeration references are already indexed automatically,
so the only fields that are explicitly marked for indexing here are generally 
time-stamps and other value fields that are known to be used in queries, and only
on key tables that play a central role in the workflow queries.

<indexes>
  <index table="ConfigurationDocument_" columns="CreationTime_"/>
  <index table="ConfigurationDocumentBody_" columns="ModifiedTime_"/>
