	/// <summary>
	/// Defines the methods and properties of the data source for a <see cref="Sop"/>.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// A sop 'data source' is merely an abstraction of what is essentially just
	/// a <see cref="DicomFile"/>.  However, because the data is not always a simple
	/// local file, we have to account for the fact that there may be parts
	/// of the implementation that must be specialized because, for example,
	/// the data exists on a remote server and might be retrieved on demand
	/// or in stages.  An example of this is the Macro Streaming implementation
	/// where:
	/// <list type="bullet">
	/// <item>A <see cref="DicomFile"/> is initially constructed from an xml
	/// document retrieved from the server.</item>
	/// <item>The xml document often will contain the entire image header, but
	/// unknown, private and large tags are excluded.  When it is determined that
	/// a tag being requested is one of these tags, the <see cref="ISopDataSource"/>
	/// will silently retrieve the entire image header on-demand.</item>
	/// <item>Pixel data is always loaded on-demand in streaming and local cases.</item>
	/// </list>
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Note that there is a significant shift in the design from previous versions
	/// of the framework, where <see cref="ISopDataSource"/> did not exist and
	/// any specializations had to be done by deriving from <see cref="ImageSop"/>.
	/// This caused a number of problems, the main one being that,
	/// when we added support for non-image <see cref="Sop"/>s (like Key Objects) and
	/// <see cref="Sop"/> became non-abstract, all of a sudden we had to create 2 specialized
	/// classes, one for <see cref="Sop"/> and one for <see cref="ImageSop"/>; there
	/// was no way around it because client code depended on checking the type (<see cref="Sop"/> or <see cref="ImageSop"/>)
	/// in order to know whether or not it was an image.  Also, <see cref="Sop"/> and <see cref="ImageSop"/>
	/// are rather large classes, and ultimately we realized that all they do
	/// is provide a convenient interface to a <see cref="DicomFile"/>.  So, why
	/// make developers inherit from <see cref="Sop"/>, <see cref="ImageSop"/> and <see cref="Frame"/>
	/// and force them to have to figure out which of the many properties and methods to override when
	/// it's really not necessary?  Also, now that we support non-image <see cref="Sop"/>s, how come
	/// there's just <see cref="Sop"/> and <see cref="ImageSop"/>?  Where's KeyImageSop and PresentationStateSop?
	/// All of a sudden, we were headed down a very bad road.  Such is development.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// So how does <see cref="ISopDataSource"/> make it easier?  The biggest way
	/// has already been mentioned, which is that it unifies all sop instances, image or otherwise, under
	/// a single interface, so you only have to implement <see cref="ISopDataSource"/> (and possibly <see cref="ISopFrameData"/>).
	/// <see cref="ISopDataSource"/> has a few specialized bits of functionality for handling of <b>large</b> image data,
	/// such as pixel data and overlays, but that's it - everything else is the same as for non-images.  The other
	/// nice thing about <see cref="ISopDataSource"/> is that it can be used with the various convenient
	/// wrapper classes in <see cref="Macro.Dicom.Iod.Modules"/>, such as <see cref="KeyObjectDocumentModuleIod"/>.
	/// The answer to the question "why isn't there a Key Object Sop?" is: there doesn't need to be.  You
	/// can simply wrap the <see cref="ISopDataSource"/> in whichever convenient IOD wrapper you need for
	/// a particular <see cref="SopClass">SOP class</see>.
