	/// <summary>
	/// An interface for an operation on an object
	/// that implements undo/redo using the Memento pattern.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// The Memento design pattern allows client code to perform undo/redo operations on
	/// an object without understanding any of the internals of how the operation is undone.
	/// All that is needed is a 'memento' from before and after any modifications are made
	/// to the object in question.  These mementos can then be used to construct a 
	/// single <see cref="MemorableUndoableCommand"/> to be entered into the 
	/// <see cref="CommandHistory"/> and the changes to the object's state
	/// can then be 'undone' and 'redone', simply be passing the memento back to the object.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// This interface is merely an abstraction that allows client code to apply the Memento
	/// pattern to an arbitrary object without any understanding of the operation being applied
	/// or the participating objects.
	/// </para>
	/// </remarks>
