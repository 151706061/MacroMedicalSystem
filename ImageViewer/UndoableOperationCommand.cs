	/// An <see cref="UndoableCommand"/> specifically for operations on objects
	/// that implement the Memento pattern using <see cref="IMemorable"/>.

	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// This class is used in conjunction with <see cref="IUndoableOperation{T}"/>, which
	/// is intended to streamline application of the same operation to objects implementing
	/// the Memento pattern via <see cref="IMemorable"/>.  See the comments for 
	/// <see cref="IUndoableOperation{T}"/> for information on the pattern
	/// of applying the operation and creating the <see cref="MemorableUndoableCommand"/>.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The <see cref="UndoableOperationCommand{T}"/> removes all the burden of properly
	/// applying the <see cref="IUndoableOperation{T}"/> and obtaining the mementos for
	/// any number of objects.  Given the <see cref="IUndoableOperation{T}"/> and a list
	/// of items to which the operation should be applied, the first call to <see cref="Execute"/>
	/// will automatically apply the <see cref="IUndoableOperation{T}"/> and populate
	/// itself with a <see cref="MemorableUndoableCommand"/> for each object that actually
	/// changed as a result of the operation.  Since the application of the operation
	/// is not guaranteed to result in any changes, you should check that the
	/// <see cref="CompositeUndoableCommand.Count"/> property is non-zero after first calling
	/// <see cref="Execute"/> before adding the <see cref="UndoableOperationCommand{T}"/>
	/// to the <see cref="CommandHistory"/>.
