	/// The action (call it Left-Hand Action) whose position in the store is to be 
	/// determined is compared with each action in the store (Right-Hand Action).
	/// The comparison of the Left-Hand Action to the Right-Hand Action is given
	/// a score.  The score is based on the GroupHint and the algorithm works 
	/// as follows:
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	///		LHS										RHS										Score
	///		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	///	1.	Tools.Image.Manipulation.Zoom			""										1
	///	2.	Tools.Image.Manipulation.Zoom			Tools.Image.Manipulation.Pan			4
	///	3.	Tools.Image.Manipulation.Zoom			DisplaySets								0
	/// 4.  ""										""										1
	/// 5.  ""										DisplaySets								0
    ///	6.	Tools.Image.Manipulation.Pan			Tools.Image.Manipulation.Zoom			-4
    /// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// A brief explanation of the logic:
	/// <list type="bullet">
	/// <item>
	/// For backward compatibility, actions with a non-empty GroupHint, when compared to an 
	/// existing action in the store whose GroupHint="", the score is 1 because it is considered
	/// a better match than 2 actions whose GroupHints are non-empty and are completely different.
	/// </item>
	/// <item>
	/// Actions with GroupHints that have similar components (separated by '.') are given a score
	/// equal to the number of (consecutive) matching components + 1.  The +1 accounts for the fact 
	/// that any number of equal components is a better score than the first example, whose score is 1.
	/// When all components in LHS are a match, but RHS has more components, the score is negative (less).
	/// When all components in RHS are a match, meaning LHS has at least the same number of components,
	/// the score is positive (greater).  Otherwise, the sign of the score is determined by examining the
	/// first non-matching component (same position in LHS and RHS) encountered and performing a string
	/// comparison of the two.  If the component in LHS is "less" than RHS, the return value is negative (less).
	/// </item>
	///  <item>
	/// Actions with completely different components are given an automatic score of zero (0).
	/// Two actions with GroupHints = "" are considered equal, so a score of 1 is given.
	/// </item>
	/// <item>
	/// In the case where an existing action with an empty GroupHint is being matched to a non-empty
	/// GroupHint, the LHS cannot be considered at all similar to RHS and the score is automatically zero (0).
	/// </item>
